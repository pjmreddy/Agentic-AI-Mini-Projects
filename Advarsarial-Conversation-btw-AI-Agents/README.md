This project demonstrates an implementation of adversarial conversations between AI chatbots using Jupyter notebooks. It explores how different AI agents can interact, debate, and engage in structured dialogues.

## Project Overview

The project contains a Jupyter notebook (`Advarsarial_Convo_Between_Chatbots.ipynb`) that showcases interactions between AI agents in a controlled environment. This implementation helps understand how AI models can engage in meaningful conversations and potentially challenge each other's responses.

### Key Features

- Implementation of multiple AI agents with distinct personalities and roles
- Structured conversation flows with turn-based interactions
- Example outputs of agent interactions demonstrating debate and reasoning
- Configurable conversation parameters for customized interactions
- Easy-to-follow implementation in Jupyter notebook format

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The project requires the following packages:

```
openai
python-dotenv
ollama
requests
ipython
jupyter
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `Advarsarial_Convo_Between_Chatbots.ipynb` to see the implementation and run the adversarial conversations between AI agents. The notebook contains detailed explanations and examples of how the agents interact with each other.

## Example Output

```
Agent 1: "Let's discuss the implications of artificial intelligence in healthcare."
Agent 2: "I'll take a critical stance. While AI shows promise in diagnosis, we must consider privacy concerns."
Agent 1: "Valid point. However, studies show AI can reduce diagnostic errors by 30%."
...
```
